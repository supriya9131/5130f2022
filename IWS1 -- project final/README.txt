ONE CLICK

AIM: It becomes overhead sometimes for user when he/she has to find the best
and lowest price for the same product on different websites/applications which
he/she wants to buy. So as the project name suggests “One Click”, it will compare
the price of the same product on different websites in just one click. When user will
search the particular product on this website, it will show the best and lowest price
of the product along with that particular website where it is available. This project
will include the use of Angular JavaScript and Bootstrap for the website frontend
development. Backend development will be done using NodeJS, API and Chrome
Automation Tool. This Website will not only give best price to the user but also
reduce the surfing time of the user to surf different websites/applications to
compare the best and lowest price of the product.
