Comparison study of web browsers based on performances

Abstract-- Everyone should have access to information in this age of globalization and modernity, and the Internet serves this purpose primarily. The entrance to the Internet is a web browser. Through the browser, you can experience the web. Web browsers serve as a conduit for accessing internet capabilities and assist us in browsing various websites for daily needs, making even the most challenging activities easier. Given the variety of choices, choosing a web browser can occasionally be challenging. Most consumers lack information while choosing a web browser. In this paper, we discuss developments in the web browser industry. We will talk about the importance and usefulness of well-known browsers like Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, etc. because they are so important in the world of the internet. Based on how well they function in various user environments, we will also assess the performance of web browsers. Over the previous ten years, we have observed numerous variations in various web browsers' versions, and we will also talk about how browsers have changed over time. This article will provide users with the necessary information and assist them in selecting a web browser.


INTRODUCTION

Global internet usage has increased dramatically because of technological improvement. The World Wide Web serves as a platform for consumers to explore the almost infinite services now available on the Internet, which has proven popular. The Internet is a global network of interconnected networks, whereas the web is a service that runs on it. A software program called a web browser is used to access data on the Internet. A web browser is a piece of software that makes queries to a server to get the data it needs to show. It navigates between numerous web pages on the World Wide Web and displays texts, multimedia, and other content. The user can download useful info with its aid. It also caches the data and is then useful when opening the same web page again which makes browsers an integral part of web browsing.

Web browsers have significantly improved over the past ten years to provide users with the capabilities they need for effective information retrieval. A person can tell that a certain browser is different from the others while they are using it to access a website. Opera, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer are the most popular browsers. To increase their quickness, security, and adaptability, browsers are updated frequently.

CONCLUSION

We attempted to compare the performance of contemporary browsers in terms of speed, ping response time, compatibility with contemporary web technologies, and ease of use. We discovered that because the web is developing daily, browsers must be updated to function properly on the user's computer. Each browser shows both strengths and weaknesses in particular areas, and we are only able to compare each of them. Chrome provided the most support for HTML5, CSS3, and other web technologies; yet Firefox proved to be the most effective browser when using multiple tabs.
In summary, everything relies on the people and how they utilize their browsers. We discovered that Firefox is highly effective for web application developers. The analysis of Chrome's response time and problems demonstrates both its advantages and disadvantages. When a user is more concerned about making use of the system's resources, we can declare the relevant consumption of Internet Explorer in terms of CPU usage.
The best browser, however, will always depend on a user's specific requirements and priorities as they relate to internet navigation.
