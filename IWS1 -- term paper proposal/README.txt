I. INTRODUCTION

A web browser is a software application that is used to access information on the Internet. 
In the past decade, web browsers have evolved tremendously to give users the necessary tools that facilitate the efficient 
retrieval of information. When someone is accessing a website with a particular browser, he or she can identify that the 
browser is different from the other. The most used browsers include Opera, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, and 
Internet Explorer. The browsers are constantly improved and updated to improve their speed, security, and flexibility. 
The goal of this paper is to discuss and compare what makes the browsers different in terms of their performance to access
website.


II. CONCLUSION
It can be deduced from the foregoing discussion that many people prefer Google Chrome as their web browser default because 
with its E-Mail facility integrated with Google facilities itself. It has a simple and minimal interface. Google Chrome 
is a level beyond both Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer. For interface, IE has too many commands/menus which make 
it look complicated. For benchmark test, Chrome is superior to the other. It also excels in terms of memory usage, 
graphical interface, the degree of friendly usage, and variety of features. So, to conclude, Google Chrome is the 
best browser, followed by Mozilla Firefox, and finally Opera. This is also evident from their respective market shares. 
Security is the most critical aspect of internet browsing. Therefore, providing more effective security features makes 
a browser more endearing to web users. We can conclude Chrome is the most secure browser while Firefox is the most private. Opera is famous for both security and privacy features. Firefox is the most private browser and can be used on any operating system, on all devices, and is also secured. Still, determining which browser is right will always depend on individual needs and what user value most as he or she navigates online.
